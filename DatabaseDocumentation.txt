This script created 3 tables in a database called TinyCollegeDB

course table
courseId (auto generated PK)
courseTitle (Title of course)
semesterOffered (semester course if offered)


student table
studentId (auto generated PK)
studentName 

enrollment table  (this is to track classes to students)
enrollmentId (auto generated PK)
courseId (FK to the course table - courseId)
studentId (FK to the student table - studentId)


Here are my thoughts on how this should work

when a student is added, we will update the student table
when a course is added, we will update the course table

Display all students will display (select * from dbo.student)

Display all courses will display (select * from dbo.course)

Enroll a student will select a student from the student table and select a course from the course table writing the results on button press to enrollment table (courseId, studentId)

Who is in a course will select a course from drop-down, and display students where courseId = selected courseId from the enrollment table

What course a student is enrolled in or has enrolled in will select a course from student selected and display all courses from the enrollment table
